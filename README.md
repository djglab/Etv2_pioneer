## The Etv2 Pioneer project

### R scripts
[ChIP_seq_preprocess.Rmd](ChIP_seq_preprocess.Rmd) R script for preprocessing Etv2 ChIP-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq and Brg1 ChIP-seq in ES/EB and MEF.  The combined ChIP-seq dataset sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UWiduM3Pv-GsVGmfxFApnyVBI1THMR8n8wHg5st3b5c/edit?usp=sharing).  

[scRNA_seq_analysis.Rmd](scRNA_seq_analysis.Rmd) R script for performing the scRNA-seq of Etv2 reprogramming in MEF. 

[diff_Etv2_motifs_between_NFR_and_nucleosome.Rmd](diff_Etv2_motifs_between_NFR_and_nucleosome.Rmd) R script for performing motif analysis of finding relatively enriched motifs in NFR compared with nucleosome within Etv2 ChIP-seq peaks regions. 

[find_de_novo_motifs_Etv2_chipseq_peaks.Rmd](find_de_novo_motifs_Etv2_chipseq_peaks.Rmd) R script for finding de novo motifs within Etv2 ChIP-seq peaks in EB and MEF.  The de novo motifs were identified by Homer. 

### Datasets

### TODO
1. Investigate the ATAC-seq fragment size profile over early, late and persis Etv2 peaks in EB/MEF
